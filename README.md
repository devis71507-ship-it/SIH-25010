## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
To address the challenges faced by small and marginal farmers, we propose the development of a multilingual, AI-powered mobile application or chatbot that delivers personalized, real-time agricultural advisory. This solution will integrate data on soil health, weather patterns, crop history, and market trends to offer tailored recommendations for crop selection, fertilizer use, irrigation, and pest control. By leveraging AI and image recognition, the app will enable farmers to identify pests and diseases through simple image uploads, while also receiving weather-based alerts and predictive insights to make informed decisions at every stage of the crop cycle.

To ensure accessibility, the platform will support regional languages and offer voice-based interaction, making it usable even for farmers with low literacy or limited digital skills. The solution will also include market price tracking to help farmers sell their produce at competitive rates, thereby improving their income. Continuous feedback loops and usage analytics will allow for iterative improvements, ensuring the advisory remains accurate, relevant, and responsive to farmers' evolving needs. Ultimately, this solution aims to empower farmers with scientific, reliable, and localized information, reducing dependency on unreliable third-party sources and promoting sustainable agricultural practices

## Feasibility and Viability
To ensure feasible visibility of the multilingual, AI-powered agricultural advisory platform among small and marginal farmers, a community-centric approach is essential. This includes partnering with local agricultural extension workers, farmer producer organizations (FPOs), and NGOs to build trust and demonstrate the app’s benefits. Village-level workshops and demo sessions in regional languages, supported by voice-based walkthroughs, can help overcome literacy barriers. The app should be optimized for low-end smartphones and offer offline functionality, SMS or IVR-based access, and lightweight design to accommodate limited connectivity and digital skills.

Further visibility can be achieved by integrating the platform with existing government services like eNAM or Kisan Call Centers, and embedding it into popular messaging apps such as WhatsApp. Collaborations with telecom providers for zero-rated access and bundled data plans can reduce usage costs. Incentives like seasonal tips, rewards, or discounts on agri-inputs can encourage engagement, while feedback analytics ensure the advisory remains accurate and relevant. Local influencers and progressive farmers can act as champions, promoting the platform through peer networks and enhancing adoption across rural communities.

## Impact and Benefits
The proposed multilingual, AI-powered agricultural advisory platform can significantly transform the lives of small and marginal farmers by democratizing access to scientific, real-time, and localized farming knowledge. By integrating data on soil health, weather, crop history, and market trends, the platform empowers farmers to make informed decisions on crop selection, fertilizer use, irrigation, and pest control—leading to improved yields, reduced input costs, and more sustainable practices. The image recognition feature allows farmers to quickly identify pests and diseases, while predictive weather alerts help mitigate climate-related risks, enhancing resilience and productivity throughout the crop cycle.

Beyond agronomic support, the platform’s voice-based and regional language interface ensures inclusivity for farmers with low literacy or limited digital skills. Market price tracking enables better negotiation and timing for selling produce, boosting income and reducing exploitation by middlemen. The continuous feedback loop and usage analytics ensure the system evolves with farmers’ needs, fostering trust and long-term engagement. Ultimately, this solution promotes self-reliance, reduces dependency on unreliable sources, and contributes to a more equitable and sustainable agricultural ecosystem.
